# SimpleFPS

An FPS game made in Unreal Engine 4.
Uses the [FPS Weapon Bundle](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/fps-weapon-bundle).

This was all made for my programming class. It isn't amazing but it works... If you want to fix this up and improve it feel free to do so and create a pull request because this is messy as hecc.
